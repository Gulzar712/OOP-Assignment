1st program

This program is like a simple calculator that you can run on your computer. Here's what it does in simple terms:

It starts by saying it's a basic calculator and asks you to enter a math expression, like "5 + 10".

It then reads what you typed using a tool called Scanner.

It checks if you typed it correctly with spaces and three parts (like number, operator, number).

If you didn't type it right, it tells you to try again. If you did, it moves on.

It tries to convert the first and third parts (the numbers) into actual numbers that the computer can understand.

If you didn't type numbers, it tells you that it's wrong. If you did, it moves on.

It looks at the second part (the operator, like +, -, *, /) to figure out what kind of math to do.

It then does the math based on the operator. For example, if you typed "5 + 10", it adds 5 and 10.

If you try to divide by zero (which you can't do in math), it tells you that it's not allowed.

Finally, it shows you the result of your math expression, like "5 + 10 = 15".

So, in short, it's a little program that lets you do simple math by typing it in. Cool, huh?

2nd program
This program is like a teacher's helper for managing student scores. It takes a string containing students' names and their corresponding scores, processes the data, and then calculates and displays some statistics. It keeps track of the total number of students, the average score, the highest scorer and their score, and the lowest scorer and their score. It's a neat way to summarize how the students are doing in terms of grades.
